# Loan Approval Prediction

Welcome to my repository for Kaggle's [Loan Approval Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10/data)!

### Project Scope

The main scope of this project is:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Train ML models, compare performances, and inversitgate the results 
3. Gain a comprehensive understanding of classical ML models from the investigations.
4. Produce modular python code which can be used as reference.
